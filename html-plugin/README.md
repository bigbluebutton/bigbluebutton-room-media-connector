# BigBlueButton Room Integration Plugin

## What is it?

This is a [BBB HTML plugin](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html-plugin-sdk) where the user can enter the PIN displayed by the [room appliance application](../appliance-application/).
It then checks this PIN with the [pairing-server](../pairing-server/) and afterwards creates the join-URLs for the applicance application.
To finish the pairing it shows the pairing pin for user confirmation.

## Usage

This is a general instruction on how to use a plugin.
For a detailed configuration example of each use case,
have a look at the READMEs in the respective [samples](samples)-folders.

### Running the Plugin from Source

For development purposes you can run the plugin locally from source:

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    cd $HOME/src/bigbluebutton-html-plugin-sdk/samples/sample-action-button-dropdown-plugin
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

2. Configure it in the `settings.yml` of the BBB HTML5 Client:
    ```yaml
    public:
      plugins:
        - name: RoomMediaPlugin
          url: http://127.0.0.1:4701/static/RoomMediaPlugin.js
          settings:
            pairingWebsocketUrl: wss://your-bbb-server.org/hybrid/ws
    ```

_N.B.:_ Be aware that in this case the url is interpreted from the plugin in the browser,
so the localhost is actually your local development machine.

### Building the Plugin

To build the plugin for deployment follow these steps:

```bash
cd $HOME/html-plugin
npm install
npm run build-bundle
```

The above command will generate the `dist` folder, containing the bundled JavaScript file named `RoomMediaPlugin.js`.
This file can be hosted on any HTTPS server.

To use the plugin with BigBlueButton, add the plugin's URL to the `settings.yml` of the BBB HTML5 Client as shown below:

```yaml
public:
  plugins:
    - name: RoomMediaPlugin
      url: <<PLUGIN_URL>>
      settings:
        pairingWebsocketUrl: wss://your-bbb-server.org/hybrid/ws
```

#### Hosting the Plugin on a BBB Server

While the plugin can be hosted on any Server, it is also possible to host the bundled file directly on
a BigBlueButton server.
For that you copy the `dist/RoomMediaPlugin.js` to the folder `/var/www/bigbluebutton-default/assets/plugins`.
In this case, the `<<PLUGIN_URL>>` above will be `https://<your-host>/plugins/RoomMediaPlugin.js`.
